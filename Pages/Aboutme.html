<h3>What I Am About?</h3>
<p>Hi guys it me again! I love many thing, but making Family guy conspiracises is the <strong>NUMBER 1</strong> thing in the world. Seth Macfarlane makes think very deeply of what his show is really about. A fat man who hates his kids or a man trying to fit in, in the real world. Is Chris even his son, is Stewie even his son.  We don't know, but it helps by lois being shown cheating on Peter way to many times.</p>
